# Talent_vs_luck_Simulation
Simulate the wealth of population based on "TALENT VERSUS LUCK: THE ROLE OF RANDOMNESS IN SUCCESS AND FAILURE"(https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068) to discuss the role of luck in one's wealth.

### Content
We simulate 1000 people with 500 events spread throught the 2D simulated world ( 2D: 500*500 array ) and when the event touches the people it has effect on their wealth. After 80 iterations( with each iteration representation event change occuring every 6 months), we simulate the wealth distribution among the popultation after 40 years.

### Result
The result shows that the the people with most IQ aren't necessary the most wealthy.
Also, the wealth distribution follows the 80/20 rule.
For detail discusion please refer to the pdf.
